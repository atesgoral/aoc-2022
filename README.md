# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

Requires Node.js 18+ to use the built-in test runner.

Place official inputs as an `input.txt` file under each day's folder.

To run all tests:

```
node --test
```

To run only simpler development inputs:

```
node --test --test-name-pattern=dev
```

To run only against official inputs:

```
node --test --test-name-pattern=official
```
